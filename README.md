# Maya Archeology VR

In the dense jungle canopies of Central America and the Yucatan, much of what remains of the Maya civilization remains hidden from view. As a consequence, many sites that are not popular tourist destinations, yet instrumental in understanding Maya culture, are seen by very few people. Items found during excavation are typically claimed for preservation in museums. Large exhibits such as temple structures, by virtue of being buildings, cannot be demonstrated to a wider audience. Our goal is to change how archaeological finds are shared by exploring digital methods for documentation and visualization. This project seeks to create immersive visualizations of the many 3D models that we have collected over the years at a Maya Archaeological site in Guatemala. We want to provide an educational and narrative experience to engage the audience into exploring an active archaeological site, while understanding key elements of the ancient Maya civilization and culture.

This project is a collaboration between [Engineers for Exploration (E4E)](http://e4e.ucsd.edu/) and the [Triton XR organization](https://tritonxr.ucsd.edu/). The Maya archaeology project in E4E focuses on collecting 3D data from the tunnelling excavations of various ancient Maya structures. We use different types of technologies, such as LiDAR, photogrammetry, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping). All of these techniques produce 3D models in the form of point clouds or meshes. This VR project uses these models to recreate the excavations to allow users to explore them at will, without the constraints of accessing the real site deep in the jungle.
